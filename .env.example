# This project now runs entirely on Cloudflare Workers.
# Wrangler secrets/bindings replace the old .env workflow.

# 1) Set the JWT secret used to sign/verify access tokens:
#    npx wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET
JWT_SECRET=replace-me

# 2) Update worker/wrangler.toml with both R2 bucket bindings:
# [[r2_buckets]]
# binding = "VOLLEY_MEDIA"
# bucket_name = "videos"
#
# [[r2_buckets]]
# binding = "VOLLEY_DATA"
# bucket_name = "volleyplus-storage"

# Any additional values (rate limits, TTLs, feature flags) can also be
# managed via Wrangler secrets/vars. This file simply documents which
# entries you should provide during setup.
